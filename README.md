# complaint-management-system
Student Complaint Management System (SCMS) is a full-stack web application that streamlines how students report campus
issues and how administrators handle them.Students can register, log in, and submit complaints by selecting a category, campus building, room number, description, and an optional photo. Each complaint receives an auto-generated ticket ID (e.g., CF-2026-0001) for easy tracking. Students can monitor their complaint's status and receive in-app notifications whenever an update is made
