# complaint-management-system
The Student Complaint Management System (SCMS) is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of reporting and resolving campus maintenance issues in a transparent and efficient manner. It provides two separate portals: a student portal where users can submit complaints under categories such as water leakage, electricity, classroom maintenance, and internet issues, and track the real-time status of their requests; and an admin portal that allows administrators to view all complaints, assign them to responsible staff, update their status, and communicate with students through comments. The system is developed using Python with the FastAPI framework for the backend, SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with security ensured through bcrypt password hashing and JWT-based authentication. Overall, the project aims to digitize campus complaint handling, reduce manual effort, and improve communication between students and administration, ensuring timely resolution of issues.
